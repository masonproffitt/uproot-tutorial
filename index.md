**This is an outdated version of the tutorial. This tutorial is now hosted at <https://hsf-training.github.io/hsf-training-uproot-webpage>.**

Welcome!
This tutorial aims to demonstrate how to quickly get started with uproot,
a Python package that can read and write files in the `.root` format without actually requiring or running the ROOT software at all
(as opposed to PyROOT, which is just an interface in Python that runs ROOT behind the scenes).
