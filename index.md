Welcome!
This tutorial aims to demonstrate how to quickly get started with [Uproot](https://github.com/scikit-hep/uproot4),
a Python package that can read and write files in the `.root` format without actually requiring or running the ROOT software at all
(as opposed to PyROOT, which is just an interface in Python that runs ROOT behind the scenes).


It was written by [Mason Proffitt](https://github.com/masonproffitt/) and first taught during the [Software Carpentry Workshop at CERN](https://indico.cern.ch/event/834411/) on November 29, 2019.
