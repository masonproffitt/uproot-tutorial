# Uproot tutorial

This is a tutorial on [Uproot](https://github.com/scikit-hep/uproot), a package for reading and writing ROOT files for columnar analysis.
It was written by [Mason Proffitt][mason] using the [Software Carpentry's][carpentries] lesson template and first taught during the [Software Carpentry Workshop at CERN](https://indico.cern.ch/event/834411/) on November 29, 2019.
